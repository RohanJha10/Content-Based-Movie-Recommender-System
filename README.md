# 🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommender System

This project is a personalized movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on their content features such as **genres, keywords, cast, and overview**. It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and similarity measures to provide accurate and efficient movie recommendations.

Built with a real-time user interface using **Streamlit**, the application allows users to input a movie title and get top recommended movies instantly.
